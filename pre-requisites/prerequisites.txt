Java:
=====
make sure that your machine has Java 8 installed and running on it.

Python:
=======
make sure that your machine has Python 2.7 (Python27) installed and running on it.

Linux:
======
Open Terminal and type:
-su [Enter]
-pip install pyserial [Enter]
-pip install matplotlib [Enter]
-pip install drawnow [Enter]
-pip install psutil [Enter]

Windows:
========
-Add python path and python scripts path to environment variables
-Open CMD as administrator and type:
-pip install pyserial [Enter]
-pip install matplotlib [Enter]
-pip install drawnow [Enter]
-pip install psutil [Enter]
-pip install pylab [Enter]

or if a package from the above ones fails to install, download and install them manually from the following:

-pyserial: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyserial
-matplotlib: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#matplotlib
-drawnow: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/drawnow
-psutil: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#psutil
-pylab: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pylab

to check if a the above modules have been installed, open a terminal or a cmd session and type:
$python [Enter]
>>import pyserial [Enter]
>>import matplotlib [Enter]
>>import drawnow [Enter]
>>import psutil [Enter]
>>import pylab [Enter]

if nothing pops up or no error occurs then the modules are installed correctly

Simulation:  (Windows only)
===========================
if you want to simulate the io hardware that we made, you should have the following programs installed and running correctly:

1- Proteus 8 or above
2- Virtual Serial Port Emulator (VSPE)

How-To:
=======
1- create a virtual COM port in VSPE
2- open the protues project and start the simulation
3- open iCode and choose input / output
4- in the proteus project there is a mode switch which selects from one of the following modes:
	a- Output Mode (Brightness Mode LED on)
	b- Slow Input Mode (Graphing Mode LED on)
	c- Fast Input Mode (Both Brightness Mode LED and Graphing Mode LED are on)

	-> when in output mode, you connect from iCode in output mode and change the brightness slider
		which will be reflected on the simulation's oscilloscope's reading

	-> when in either mode of input, you connect from iCode in the corresponding input mode and change the potentiometers value
		which will be reflected on a graphing oscilloscope opened by iCode
